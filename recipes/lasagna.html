        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Prep</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Combine the cheese filling ingredients in a medium bowl and set
            aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Meat sauce</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them
            soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar
            which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high.
            Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and
            crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic
            during the last minute. Drain excess grease.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the
            bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste,
            hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to
            a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently while you
            boil the pasta noodles
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cook noodles</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 375°</li>
          <li>
            Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water for the lasagna
            noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, cook the noodles to al dente
            according to package instructions. (Set a timer to ensure you don’t
            overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking
            to prevent the noodles from sticking. Drain and rinse with cold
            water until noodles are completely cool.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you
            begin assembling the lasagna
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Assemble</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch
            casserole dish. Next, add 4 lasagna noodles, overlapping them if
            needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed
            by about 1 ½ cups of meat sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Top with 4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture,
            1 ½ cups meat sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finish with 4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture,
            and the rest of the meat sauce.
          </li>
          <li>Top with 2 ½ cups of Mozzarella cheese.</li>
          <li>
            Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray and place it spray-side-down
            on top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Bake</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Bake for 35 minutes. Remove cover and bake for 10 more minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. Let it sit for 15 minutes
            prior to serving to allow the layers to set. Serve with garlic bread
            with cheese.
          </li>
