        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>The first step is to caramelize the onions</li>
          <li>
            In a large 12-inch skillet, heat the olive oil and butter over
            medium-high heat. Once the oil is shimmering and the butter is
            melted, add the diced onions. Stir to coat. Reduce heat to
            medium-low stirring occasionally until the onions reach desired
            consistency and color: 15-20 minutes for sweet blonde caramelized
            onions, 30-40 minutes for jammier well-browned onions, 60 minutes
            for the ultimate deeply sweet and jammy caramelized onions If the
            onions start to stick, drizzle a little water into the pan to
            deglaze the pan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn the heat up to medium high heat and toss the diced green
            peppers in. Cook until they have softened, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add
            the beef, adobo seasoning and seasoned salt
          </li>
          <li>
            Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to
            400 degrees Fahrenheit.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise and ketchup. Arrange the
            hoagie rolls on a baking sheet and spread the mayo and ketchup
            mixture evenly on both sides of each roll.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combine the beef, onion, adobo seasoning, and seasoned salt in a
            large 12-inch skillet set over medium high heat. Cook for 8 minutes,
            constantly breaking up the meat into small pieces with a wooden
            spoon. The meat should be cooked through and the excess moisture
            cooked off
          </li>
          <li>
            Divide the cooked beef evenly among the rolls and layer 2 slices of
            American cheese over the beef on each roll.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake in the oven until the bread is warm and the cheese is melted,
            about 5 minutes
          </li>
          <li>
            Take the rolls out of the oven and layer tomatoes and lettuce over
            the cheese on each roll. Carefully close each sandwich. Pop the
            sandwiches back in the oven for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the filling
            to meld together.
          </li>
          <li>
            Take out of the oven and let the sandwiches sit for 1 minute before
            cutting in half to serve.
          </li>
          <li>
            Optional Pro Tip: For a real bodega deli shop feel and a filling
            that melds together perfectly, carefully close the sandwich after
            the tomatoes and lettuce have been added and wrap tightly in
            parchment paper. To serve, cut the sandwiches in half
          </li>
